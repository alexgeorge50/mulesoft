# Mulesoft Repository

Mulesoft repository contains two file.
1. mulesoft.sql file which contains the database objects and query, to create a schema, create a table and inserting values into the table.
2. mulesoft folder which contains other two individual file. They are:
       sample.java : which contains the java code for database connectivity
       mulsoft.iml

Note: I used intellij IDEA community to write this java code. In order for database connnectivity, I used the JDBC connector.
