# Mulesoft Repository

Mulesoft repository contains two file.
1. mulesoft.sql file which contains the database objects and query, to create a schema, create a table and inserting values into the table.
2. mulesoft folder which contains other two individual file.
They are:
       (1)  sample.java which contains the java code for database connectivity
       (2)  mulsoft.iml

Note: I used intellij IDEA community to write this java code. In order for database connnectivity, I used the JDBC connector. I ahd install JDBC connector plugin in intellij IDEA.

I did try REST API integration, but couldn't finish it.
